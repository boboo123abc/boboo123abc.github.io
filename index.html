        <p>Something excited happened. I was in a skating session &#128761; with my friend Joey when all of the sudden, my old friend Nemo walked by. I hadn't seen him for over five years! We talked and talked and we promised to stay in contact. He's also still skating, so that's probably what we're going to do the next time we meet up. It's always great to meet an old friend!&#128516;</p>

        <p>Wow! I really didn't expect so many people to read my first post.. Glad you all liked it so much!!&#128522; I thought I should introduce myself, now that so many people followed this blog. <br>My name is Franca and I am 16 years old. In my128522; freetime I play soccer (but at the moment I can't train with my team because of Covid-19&#128533;) and make music. I play a couple instruments and I am currently learning how to use DAWs. I also like to cook :) <br>
I hope you all enjoy my posts, see you next time!&#128151;</p>
