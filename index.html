I didn't land it though. But it felt pretty cool, and bringing the board to flip is actually not that easy. &#128524; The rest of session went pretty well but at then three police officers came and told us that we had to leave.&#128529; </td>

        <p>Wow! I really didn't expect so many people to read my first post.. Glad you all liked it so much!!&#128522; I thought I should introduce myself, now that so many people followed this blog. <br>My name is Franca and I am 16 years old. In my128522; freetime I play soccer (but at the moment I can't train with my team because of Covid-19&#128533;) and make music. I play a couple instruments and I am currently learning how to use DAWs. I also like to cook :) <br>
